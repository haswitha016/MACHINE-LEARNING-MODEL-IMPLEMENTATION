##Task 4 â€“ Machine Learning Model Implementation
This task focused on building and evaluating machine learning models using Python. The goal was to train a model that can classify outcomes based on given input features. For demonstration, the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset was used, which contains medical data such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, and whether the patient is diabetic or not.

##The implementation involved:

Loading and preprocessing the dataset

Splitting the data into training and testing sets

Applying Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier

Evaluating the models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
